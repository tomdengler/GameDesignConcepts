###Level 2 Notes

game design is the creation of the rules and content of a game. It does not involve programming, art or animation, or marketing, or any of the other myriad tasks required to make a game.


tasks associated with game design
- system design: defining the basic rules of the game
- level design, 
- content design, 
- user interface design, 
- world building, and 
- story writing.

System design is about defining the basic rules of the game
- Rules for setup. How does the game begin?
- Rules for progression of play
- Rules for resolution. (game end, win/lose, etc)

Scientific Method (process)
- making hypotheses
- deriving predictions from them as logical consequences
- carrying out experiments based on those predictions.

**The purpose of iteration is to lower design risk**
**the more you iterate on a game, the better it becomes**
